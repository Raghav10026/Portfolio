    <p>The brain is comprised of several lobes, as we all can gander. Each lobe has a differing function which holds an impact on how exactly music impacts it. The Frontal Lobe The frontal lobe is located at the very front of the brain, and the human frontal
        lobe is the largest in all mammals. It’s the lobe outlined in the pinkish-red coloration above. The overall function of this lobe is to control decision making and planning—so essentially it’s like the mother of your bain, seeing as most mothers
        control decision making and planning in families. Music is said to enhance all of the functions within the frontal lobe, which is good for us.[1] The Temporal Lobe The lobe outlined in yellow, kind of directly above the brain stem, is what is
        primarily tasked with processing what we hear. When music is played, it presents an exercise of sorts for both sides of the brain; the words and language are all interpreted in the left hemisphere while the sound and music are all interpreted
        in the right hemisphere. The Broca's Area The little thing in green is tasked with speech production… in other words, it is tasked with controlling whatever you yell back to your mother when she tried making decisions for you (in a sense at the
        very least). Music, in specific playing an instrument, has been proven to better communication— something that better helps everyone in life. The Hypothalamus This area, outlined in blue, in essence, plays a role in bodily homeostasis; it links
        the nervous and endocrine systems, plays a role in the release/production of essential hormones, and more. Music can impact this depending on the type—more classical music can lower blood pressure and the heart rate for example. The Putamen Controlling
        bodily rhythm and coordination, music has been seen to hold a rather interesting impact on this. Parkinson's patients have responded to rhythmic music, which has been proven to help them balance and walk whilst on. That's nice and all, but what
        more practical impacts does music have on the brain? Music helps with Pain. Jessabelle suffers from fibromyalgia, a disease that can cause extreme pain in patients. In 2014, a study was completed that allowed participants to listen to relaxing
        music of their choice. The results showed a reduction in pain along with an increase in mobility. [2] Music generally has been proven to release natural opioids into the body— which are commonly administered as pain medication to some. Stress
        Relief has also been linked to music, especially in pediatric patients. Cassandra loves music, but unfortunately, she has to visit the hospital for some treatments. She needed an IV bag whilst visiting, and her doctors recalled a 2013 study. This
        study looked at pediatric patients ranging from 3–11 years old in emergency room situations; they played music the patient selected during their IV insertion and noticed it led to reduced pain and overall stress. Ahh, sweet old memory! Where would
        we be without you? As you would anticipate, memory is impacted by music as well! Research dating back to the 20th century found that music being played can induce remembrance of something from decades prior— a very cool realization. In fact, in
        Alzheimer’s patients, music was found to help the patients recall certain memories from years before, which was incredible for them to see. A different study was conducted with dementia patients in 2014, in which 89 patients were split into 3
        groups. One group was given a 10-week music listening coach, one a 10-week singing coach, and one with regular care. The results showed that “compared with usual care, both singing and music listening improved mood, orientation, and remote episodic
        memory and to a lesser extent, also attention and executive function and general cognition. Singing also enhanced short-term and working memory and caregiver well-being, whereas music listening had a positive effect on [the] quality of life.”
        On another note, music has been observed to hold even more differing effects on patients recovering from seizures, brain injuries, and/or strokes. Epileptic patients observed that stress-induced seizures occurred in some cases. However, they also
        noticed when the patient had music on they were more relaxed. Jeff is a stroke patient but in the early stages of stroke recovery. His doctors instructed him to put some music on, going off of a 2008 study they had learned about. This study showed
        that those who listened to music soon after the stroke showed a 60% positive change 3 months post one week after the stroke as opposed to those who didn't listen to music. Music helps keep the brain healthy and communicating via the corpus callosum
        to each hemisphere. For example, professional musicians have been found to have healthier brains with a larger corpus callosum, meaning the hemispheres of their brain communicate more than the average person.[3] Sad music helps release emotions,
        helping the brain heal in difficult situations. Additionally, employees that are allowed to select their music completed tasks more efficiently than those without music or with music they didn't like. On another note, listening to music was found
        to increase the desire someone holds to help others— and in both adults and children. Music reaps a plethora of benefits on the human brain, both long term, and short term. It helps both the young and old and in incredible ways. With research
        consistently changing, who knows what else will be discovered with music and the brain. Possibilities quite literally are limitless in research, especially neurological research if the Human Brain Project works— but I digress. From memory and
        connections to stress-relief, the human brain truly does need music to a degree for optimum functionality.</p>
